# Rotating Knob Selector

A customizable and very powerful button that replicates the behaviour of a knob with discrete values.<br>
The knob is a very powerful tool, that I could not find in the Android panorama:

* It's of immediate understanding to the user
* It occupies a very small space
* It can manage any number of values without taking more space
* It can be used as a way to insert data, and also for navigation as a page selector

<i>This version is still in beta and still misses a number of features that are going to be added in the next future.</i>
