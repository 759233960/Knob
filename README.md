# Rotating Knob Selector

A customizable and very powerful button that replicates the behaviour of a knob with discrete values.<br><br>

The knob is a very powerful tool, that I could not find in the Android panorama:

* It's of immediate understanding to the user
* It occupies a very small space
* It can manage any number of values without taking more space
* It can be used as a way to insert data, and also for navigation as a page selector

<i>This version is still in beta and still misses a number of features that are going to be added in the next future.</i>

### Setup
In your project's build.gradle file:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            ...
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
            ...
        }
    }

In your Application's or Module's build.gradle file:

    dependencies {
        ...
        compile 'com.github.BeppiMenozzi:Knob:1.0.0'
        ...
    }
